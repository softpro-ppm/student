# Student Registration Bar Chart Implementation

## Overview
Added a responsive bar chart to the dashboard.php showing student registrations for the past 6 months.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Chart.js Library
- Added Chart.js CDN link in the `<head>` section
- Script tag: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>`

### 2. Added PHP Data Processing
- Created PHP code to fetch student registration data for the past 6 months
- Since the `tblcandidate` table doesn't have a registration date field, the implementation uses `CandidateId` as a proxy for registration order
- Data is distributed across 6 months based on the CandidateId range

### 3. Added HTML Chart Container
- Added a Bootstrap card containing the chart canvas
- Card has a professional header with icon and title
- Canvas element: `<canvas id="registrationChart" width="400" height="100"></canvas>`

### 4. Added JavaScript Chart Configuration
- Created a responsive bar chart using Chart.js
- Features include:
  - Colorful bars with different colors for each month
  - Responsive design that adapts to screen size
  - Professional styling with border radius and hover effects
  - Smooth animations
  - Custom tooltips
  - Grid lines and proper scaling

## Chart Features
- **Type**: Bar chart
- **Data**: Past 6 months of student registrations
- **Colors**: Each month has a unique color
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Interactive**: Hover effects and tooltips
- **Height**: Fixed at 300px for optimal viewing

## Data Source Limitation
**Important Note**: The current implementation uses `CandidateId` as a proxy for registration order since there's no dedicated registration date field in the `tblcandidate` table.

### Recommended Improvement
For accurate registration tracking, consider adding a registration date field to the database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tblcandidate ADD COLUMN registration_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

Then update the PHP query to:
```php
$sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM tblcandidate 
        WHERE DATE_FORMAT(registration_date, '%Y-%m') = :month";
```

## File Location
- **Modified File**: `/dashboard.php`
- **Lines Added**: Approximately 60+ lines including PHP, HTML, and JavaScript

## Browser Compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers
- Requires JavaScript to be enabled
- Uses Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to the dashboard.php page
2. The chart should appear below the dashboard cards
3. Verify that the chart displays 6 months of data
4. Check responsiveness on different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements
1. Add filters to view different time periods (3 months, 1 year)
2. Add drill-down functionality to show daily registrations
3. Include additional metrics like batch assignments
4. Add export functionality for chart data
