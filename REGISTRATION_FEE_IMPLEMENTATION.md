# Registration Fee Implementation - SoftPro Admin

## 🎯 Overview
This implementation adds proper registration fee support to the SoftPro Admin payment system. Every candidate now pays ₹100 registration fee + their job role fee.

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. **Database Layer Updates**
- **Helper Functions Added** in `payment.php`:
  - `check_registration_fee_paid()` - Checks if registration fee is paid
  - `get_registration_fee_amount()` - Gets total registration fee paid
  - `get_total_paid_amount()` - Gets total amount paid by candidate

### 2. **Payment Calculation Logic**
- **Total Fee Calculation**: Registration Fee (₹100) + Job Roll Fee
- **Balance Calculation**: Total Fee - Already Paid - Discount - New Payment
- **Payment Status**: Tracks registration fee separately from course payments

### 3. **User Interface Improvements**
- **Fee Breakdown Section**: Shows itemized registration + course fees
- **Payment Status Indicator**: Shows if registration fee is paid
- **Enhanced Form Layout**: Clear display of paid amounts and balances
- **Professional Styling**: Better visual organization

### 4. **Receipt Updates**
- **Itemized Payments**: Shows separate lines for registration fee and course payments
- **Payment Mode Tracking**: Distinguishes between payment types
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing payment records

### 5. **Candidate Registration**
- **Auto Registration Fee**: New candidates automatically get ₹100 registration fee payment
- **Payment Record Creation**: Automatically creates payment tracking

## 🚀 Features
