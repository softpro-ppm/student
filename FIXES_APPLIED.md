# Payment Form Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

✅ **Removed unnecessary debug elements**
   - Removed debug info bar from payment.php
   - Removed "Hide Debug" and "Refresh Data" buttons
   - Removed "Fix Balances" and "Pending Approvals" buttons from manage-candidate.php

✅ **Fixed total fee calculation**
   - Consolidated duplicate candidate/jobroll fetching code
   - Fixed variable calculation order
   - Total fee now correctly shows job roll payment amount (1500) instead of just registration fee (100)

✅ **Cleaned up payment form structure**
   - Removed broken debug sections that were interrupting form display
   - Form should now display all fields properly:
     - Student information (enrollment, name, father name, village)
     - Payment breakdown (registration fee + course fee)
     - Payment fields (total fee, discount, pay amount, balance, payment mode)
     - Action buttons (Make Payment, Back, Print)

✅ **Streamlined codebase**
   - Removed duplicate SQL queries
   - Removed temporary debug files
   - Cleaned up variable initialization logic

## Expected Result:

When you visit `student.softpromis.com/payment.php?last_id=1767`, you should now see:

- **Total Fee:** ₹1500 (not 100.00)
- **Balance:** ₹1500 (not 100)  
- **Complete payment form** with all fields visible
- **No debug elements** or unnecessary buttons
- **Clean, professional interface** like it was before

## Test Instructions:

1. Visit payment page for candidate 1767
2. Verify total fee shows 1500
3. Verify all form fields are visible and functional
4. Try making a test payment to ensure it works properly

The system should now work exactly as it did before, but with the ₹100 registration fee properly included in the total calculations.
